    <h2>My Smart/Academic Goals</h2>
    <p>
        My academic goal for 2023 is to attain and hold all A's in my schooling for the whole school year by doing all of my homework in my free time. I want to because the better my grades the more likely I am to get into the college I want into, and the better chance for opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        My personal smart goal for this year was to get abs. I have not gotten abs yet but I have been working hard at it. Before the end of the year I will most likely have them with how much I've been going to the gym. 
        My long term goal is to get into college and become a web designer for a big company. Going through this year I have learned a lot about html programming and I know it will help to reach my long term goals.
