    <h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite book series I've read this year is Drift X by Todd Strasser, this series falls in the action and romance categories mainly. The series follows Kennin, a tall, and athletic asian kid who just moved to Los Angeles after leaving Florida after he lost his friend drifting in the rain in a car they were boosting. In LA, Kennin learns that secrets are never truly secret and people pay in favors when he starts drifting again and it leads to him running from the cops because his friend's cousin Raoul boosted a car with Lojack and it sets off a series of events that will change his life forever.</p>
    <p>
        Something I took away from this book is that even though blood is thicker than water, your friends are also extremely important and you should keep them just as close as your family. I learned this from Kennin who even when in the toughest pinch he was always there for his friends and family and in the long run it was super helpful.

    <p>
        I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars because it is extremely engaging and the action from the races make you feel as if you are actually there feeling everything that is happening.
    </p>

        I recommend this book to anyone who likes cars and drifting.
