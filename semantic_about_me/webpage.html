    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="me.jpg" alt="Me">
    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>My name is Alex Heitzenrater. I was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in June of 2006 and was shortly after brought into Michigan where I was raised for the rest of my life.
        I moved schools a lot growing up and ended up in three different elementary schools before settling.
        I enjoy playing video games with my friends and playing guitar and I am now a senior in highschool attending the Web and App Development program in the Career Tech Center.
        I chose to join the Web And App Development class because technology has always fascinated me. 
        I used to be in the greek squad which was the high school class you would go to when your school computer needed repairs and after working on the hardware I figured I would try software development. 
        I'll be graduating this year, and after I graduate I will be going to NMC to continue developing software.</p>
